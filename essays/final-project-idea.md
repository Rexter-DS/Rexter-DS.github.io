# Reviews for professors and classes

## The problem
  Some professors are fairly new and does not have reviews online so students know what to expect when taking a class from the professor. It is also difficult to know how a class you're planning to take would be unless you know people that have already taken the class.

## The solution
  A website specially made for University of Hawaii that students can go on and post their experiences with professors and classes that they have taken.
  
## Mockup page ideas
A landing page that gives a description of the website. It also shows a navbar where you can use to search up classes or professors.

A login page to make sure that the person is a part of the school and not just a random person. The posts that someone will make is shown as anonymous to protect the identities.

## Use case ideas
Students login to verify that they are a student of the school. They can search up professors or classes to leave reviews for.

Professors can login and advertise their classes and explain what their courses are and what to expect out of it.

## Beyond the basics
Use UH login instead of meteor login to verify students
