## Expectations
Coming into the class, I had somewhat of an idea of what to expect because I had a friend who had previously taken the class before. I asked him how the classs was and what he did in it. He told me that the class was all about learning javascript and that was all he had said about the matter. Due to that, all I was prepared for was to learn all about javascript and was not at all expecting that I would learn so much more.

## What I learned
Although the base of what I did in class was to code and learn in javascript, we also learned other concepts unrelated to that such as using Agile Project Management to manage a project effectively. Although I did not get to fully use it to the extent of what it should have been used, I felt like it was a very important experience because it shows another way of managing a project. This was because all I knew about project management was to use SCRUM and to use trello as a way of keeping track of which was being worked on. This showed me that you could use a feature right on github that was very similar to trello but better because you could assign it to whoever was working on an issue. This could also be used beyond web application development because it is not the only thing that could be published on github. You could also use issue-driven management if you are working in a team to make a video game.

I also learned about ethics in software engineering which was a very interesting learning experience because it was a topic that I had previously not heard about. When you say the word "ethics", software engineering is not really the first thing that comes to mind, but this class has taught me that the concept of such thing exists. 

## Purpose
I had previously taught that the class was just all about web application, but I had learned other valuable lessons throughout the semester. Learning web application was a very interesting experience but I also enjoyed learning about other concepts other than web developing because I feel like it had made me into a better and more rounded software engineer.
