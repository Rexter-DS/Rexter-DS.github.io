## Smart questions? What is that?

  Eric Raymond wrote a blog about asking smart questions, but what exactly does it mean? Well, a smart question is a question that had a lot of thought put into it. It is a question that shows you had tried to solve your problem on your own using various ways of methods. These methods could be reading the API, manual, using google to search for phrases related to your problem, etc. 
  
  There are benefits to yourself if you try to solve your problem on your own first before asking a question. A very important benefit is that you get to understand the solution better because you made sense of it on your and made connections to how it solves the problem. This means that you are more likely to remember the solution once a similar problem comes up rather than if someone simply told you the solution. 
  
  Another reason to try and find a solution to your problem first is that this shows that you respect the time of the person you are asking. This is because you avoid wasting the person's time with a question that could have been simply looked up on google in less than a minute. The person could have been feeling overwhelmed with other tasks that they needed to get done, and taking the time off from those tasks to answer an easily searchable question is rude to the person.
  
## An example of a smart question 

  Now that we have established what is a smart question and why it is beneficial to ask them, what is an example of a smart question?

  Why is this an example of a smart question?
  
  The person who asked the question had attempted to solve his own question by trying to search phrases related to his problem on Google. Not only did he use Google, he had also shown the exact error in his program that he encountered. 
  
  Another reason why this is an example of a smart question is that he formulated his own idea of what could be a potential answer to his question. This means that not only did he try to solve his own problem first before asking, he had also thought on his own as to what could be a potential answer.
  
  This question was also able to be answered in such a way that was very informative and insightful, and since he had turned up empty when he searched up his own question, other people later down the line who might also encounter the same problem would now have their answer just by searching it up.

## An example of a not-smart question
 
  This would not be complete without a counter example for the opposite of a smart question.
  
  [This would be an example of a not-smart question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28588915/how-do-you-write-a-line-of-output)
  
  This is an example because although basic questions could be considered a smart question depending on how you ask it, however, this was not a smart question because it could have been easily solved by searching it up on google. In fact, searching up the phrase ["How to output hello world"](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=how+to+output+hello+world) in Google, brings up many different guides on how to do it and in various languages as well. Not only was it a very easy question to search up, it also does not contribute to anyone because there are plenty of well made guides for people starting out in programming that this question does not serve a purpose to anyone but the person asking it.
