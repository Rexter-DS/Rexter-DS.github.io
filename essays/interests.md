## Interests in software engineering 

My main interest in software engineering is pursuing a career related in the fields of robotics. This was mainly due to being a part of my high school's robotics team which helped me realized that I enjoyed programming. It was because I was tasked with programming the robot together with a few of my teammates. I found out just how much I enjoyed solving the little problems that came up as I was coding as well as how certain features would be implemented in a way that it would be efficient. In addition to enjoying the programming aspect, I also really loved seeing something being built from scratch. Once I saw the robot finished, it felt very accomplishing because its a physical proof of how hard you worked together as a team.

Although my experiences in high school was a major reason why I want to pursue a career in software engineering, I had always taken an interest, or rather been very curious, as to how games were developed. I had always wanted to create my own video game because growing up, I had played a lot of video games. I wanted to create my own that no one had seen and also to satisfy my own need to play something that I would like. Furthermore, I felt like if I made my own video game, then I could create one that would be playable together with my friends and we could make it our own thing that we build and improve piece by piece as we play.

## Future?

In the future, I want to develop skills that would help me pursue a career in one of my interests, or any other interests that I find later in life. For example, I would wish to develop the skills on using game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine. I feel like to obtain these necessary skills, I would have to either get them by experience by working in a related field as an Intern or teaching them to myself. Teaching them fully to myself is somewhat of a slow process because I have other priorites that I have to worry about also, which means that getting them by experience would be more helpful to me. This also solves two problems at once because if I would be developing the skills that I want while working in a field related to my interests.
