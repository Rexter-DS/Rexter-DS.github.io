## Overview
 
 Our task were to create an application that such that the user can easily track their data and how much greenhouse gas they are reducing, with the goal of inspiring more people to be environmentally conscious and take actions in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. The application hopes to also reduce vehicle miles traveled and facilitate the education and adopption of alternate fuel vehicles.
 
## Contribution 

My contribution for the project was creating the main dashboard that the user will see when they log in. The dashboard contains various data with graphs to visualize those data. The data includes things such as the total miles they saved, the total amount of fuel they saved, and even a monthly report where it shows how much greenhouse gas the reduced.

## Internship

This project started out as a class project as a way for our class to experience software development with a real client, Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI). After the semester was over, they asked a few students to continue the project over the summer for an internship which I received. We were then tasked to compile all the features that they liked from each group into one project.
